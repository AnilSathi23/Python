# Python
Contains Details about Python


Programming Essentials
 - Data types and Variables
 - Operators in Python
 - Conditional & Iterative Constructs
 - Data Structures in Python
 - Exception Handling
 - OOPs Concepts - Object & Classes, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Data Abstraction
 - Project

 Python Libararies (Not Included)
 - NumPy
 - Pandas
 - Matplotlib & Seaborn

 What is Python?
 - High Level Language (Syntax is similar to Natural langulage) 
 - Interpreted Language (Execute it line by line)

PYTHON IS OPEN SOURCE And can be Executed in Windows, LINUX and MACOS

Why is Phthon being Interpreted langulage and still it is faster what could be the reason.
Python has extensive Libararies

Phthon itself is slow. However, using libaries it can perform operations faster
Numpy, Pandas, Skylearn, Tensorflow and Pytorch

Python is able to collaborate it with Libarries build on other technologies like C.

Python though it Interpreted uses Just in Time compilers.

Python is used 
- data analytics
- data science
- web development
- gaming
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- Gen AI


 Guido Van Rossum
He was working with 
ABC programming langulage

- Easy to write
- Not Extensible
- No error Handling Technique
- Closed and Rigid
